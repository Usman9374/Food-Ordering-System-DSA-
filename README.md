# Food-Ordering-System-DSA-
For my DSA project, I built a C++ Food Ordering System using doubly linked lists for customers, a BST for the menu, and a queue for orders. Features included authentication, order history, an admin panel, and file handling for data persistence. It reinforced algorithmic efficiency and real-world DSA applications.
